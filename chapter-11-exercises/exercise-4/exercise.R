# Exercise 4: practicing with dplyr

# Install the `"nycflights13"` package. Load (`library()`) the package.
# You'll also need to load `dplyr`
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)

# The data frame `flights` should now be accessible to you.
# Use functions to inspect it: how many rows and columns does it have?
# What are the names of the columns?
# Use `??flights` to search for documentation on the data set (for what the 
# columns represent)


# Use `dplyr` to give the data frame a new column that is the amount of time
# gained or lost while flying (that is: how much of the delay arriving occured
# during flight, as opposed to before departing).
my_flights <- mutate(flights, delay_in_flight = (arr_delay - dep_delay))

# Use `dplyr` to sort your data frame in descending order by the column you just
# created. Remember to save this as a variable (or in the same one!)
my_flights <- arrange(my_flights, delay_in_flight)

# For practice, repeat the last 2 steps in a single statement using the pipe
# operator. You can clear your environmental variables to "reset" the data frame


# Make a histogram of the amount of time gained using the `hist()` function



# On average, did flights gain or lose time?
# Note: use the `na.rm = TRUE` argument to remove NA values from your aggregation
# A summarizing operation
average_lose_time <- summarise(my_flights, mean_delay_in_flight = mean(delay_in_flight, na.rm = TRUE))
print(average_lose_time)

# Create a data.frame of flights headed to SeaTac ('SEA'), only including the
# origin, destination, and the "gain_in_air" column you just created
to_SEA <- filter(my_flights, dest == "SEA")
to_SEA <- select(to_SEA, origin, dest, delay_in_flight)

# On average, did flights to SeaTac gain or loose time?
average_lose_time_to_SEA <- summarise(to_SEA, mean_delay_in_flight = mean(delay_in_flight, na.rm = TRUE))
print(average_lose_time_to_SEA)

# Consider flights from JFK to SEA. What was the average, min, and max air time
# of those flights? Bonus: use pipes to answer this question in one statement
# (without showing any other data)!
